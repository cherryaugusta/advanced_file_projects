Assignment 1: Python File Operations

Objective:
Practice core file handling operations in Python using real-world scenarios.

Tasks:
1. Create a text file named "tasks.txt" and write 5 task descriptions.
2. Read the file line by line and display each task.
3. Append two additional tasks to the file.
4. Convert the task list into a CSV file named "tasks.csv".
5. Create a backup copy of the original text file named "tasks_backup.txt".

Requirements:
- Use context managers ('with' statements)
- Handle files safely using pathlib
- Ensure files are created in the correct directory

Expected Outcome:
Demonstrate confidence in reading, writing, appending, converting, and backing up files using Python.
