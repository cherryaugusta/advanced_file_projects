Python File Handling Notes

1. File Modes:
- r   : read
- w   : write (overwrite existing file)
- a   : append
- rb  : read binary
- wb  : write binary

2. Context Managers:
- Always use 'with' to ensure files are closed properly
- Prevents resource leaks and file locks

3. Reading Techniques:
- read()        : reads entire file into memory
- readline()    : reads one line at a time
- readlines()   : reads all lines into a list

4. Writing Techniques:
- write()       : writes a single string
- writelines()  : writes multiple strings

5. Common Libraries:
- csv     : structured tabular data
- json    : structured hierarchical data
- shutil  : file copying and archiving

6. Best Practices:
- Always specify encoding (utf-8)
- Avoid hard-coded file paths
- Use pathlib instead of os.path
